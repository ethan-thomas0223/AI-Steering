The name of the game is: Maze Rollers

The intent of the game is just to be simple maze game where you try to find you way out/through the maze.

The narrative is that you are some one/object making your way through this maze and you are hunted by these orbs that will try to hinder your movement but are otherwise easy to out run if you are quick on your feet and willing to take risk without knowing where you're going.

You are able to use the arrow keys to move your character or you could use the wasd keys to move. The mouse is used to adjust the camera viewpoint.

The aesthetic is dark terrain and creepy vibes with the music. The orbs actually have the layout of the maze on them which is like a challeng to see if you are willing to put up with them to get a glimpse of what the maze looks like instead of traversing the whole maze.

The struggle with this game was by far the communictaion to cordinate who was suppose to be doing what or who would want to do something over another. There was joy when we found good music that fit the creepy vibes of going through a dark maze and when the layout itself started to come together as a whole.

The music and material for the terrain were pulled from free download sources found by Garrett. The rest of the coding and hooking up the scenes was from what was learned in class and the unity manuel online.

Taryn- Initially I had worked on fixing an issues that were arising on the first run through and hooking up some of the scripts and the getting the project posted onto itch. During the revision I finished wrapping up the game and incorporated more exit points to give more of a challenge to the player. I also added more "enemies" that would get in the way of the player after seeking the player out.
